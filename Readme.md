Hello, visitors!

This is the repository hosting my https://tst.legal Github Page, which contains nothing but a link to my website https://tst.bar and email brief@tst.bar.

Wonder why? Because literally everyone seeing them was unable to not associate `bar` with a bar. This is even so for those in the legal profession who themselves refer to counsel or barrister as bar all the time.

That's it. See you at https://tst.bar.
