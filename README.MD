Hello, visitors!

This is the repository hosting my [https://tst.legal](https://tst.legal) Github Page, which contains nothing but a link to my personal website [https://tst.bar](https://tst.bar) and email [brief@tst.bar](brief@tst.bar).

Wonder why? Because literally everyone seeing them was unable to not associate `bar` with a bar. This is even so for those in the legal profession who themselves refer to counsel or barrister as bar all the time.

That's it. See you at [https://tst.bar](https://tst.bar).
